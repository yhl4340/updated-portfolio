# Challenges:

- Resume. Not quite sure how to present what I am doing now in my existing resume that will showcase what I have learned and done so far.
- linkedIn- needs lot of work since i just created the account yesterday
- Issue faced today. Not all components were loaded when I was viewing on github page. Had to create a new repo.
