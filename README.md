# updated-portfolio2-16-2019
--Revised the content in previous bootstrap homework
--Added homeworks and project 1 to the profolio page.
--Added email infor and contact number to the contact page.
--Added linkd to github, linkedin, and to resume. 

Challenges:
--CSS. Trying to make sure that everything works continues to be an issue. Watching tutorials on Youtube somestimes help resolve those issues.
--Resume. Not quite sure how to present what I am doing now in my existing resume that will showcase what I have learned and done so far.
--linkedIn- needs lot of work since i just created the account yesterday
--Issue faced today. Not all components were loaded when I was viewing on github page. Had to create a new repo.
